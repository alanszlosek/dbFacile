FUTURE ITEMS AND IDEAS

- experiment with unbuffered queries for fetchAll, and return the result (less data duplication and copying)
- important (got a comment about this): quote all table and field references in single-quotes or backticks, whichever is appropriate for connected DB
- fix the workaround for when you don't want fields escaped or quoted (insert/update)
- table prefix to prepend to all tables (except for hand-typed queries)? might be too much work
- getTables()
- error out if don't have dbHandle
- check for valid tables passed to insert(), update(), delete()

- return generated primary key on insert for mssql
	- possibly use information_schema
	- use scope_identity() ... needs testing

- fetchRow to use limit for some DBs?
- PDO for sqlite3
- mssql table info

BAD IDEAS

- fetchColumn implodes all columns in query and then appends to value array
